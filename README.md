Help your neighbourhood get supplies in the most efficient and safe way possible. Alert your locality on available essentials in the neighbourhood by using Neighbourhood Supply. 

### How to use:
1. Ask for any essentials you need and find places that can supply 

2. If you know of a place or person (it can be you, too) who are willing to share or sell these supplies, fill up so that neighbors who donâ€™t know canâ€™t find it here

Please help us reduce panic and make a way to peacefully coexist in this time of crisis. 

## What is it ?
It's a Tool for people to find nearest supplies, let it be groceries, food provisions, sanitizers or masks. It can be listed here and you can know where the nearest supply is available.

## Why is it helpful ?

During ðŸ¦ **COVID-19** lockdowns, it's really difficult to get outside for gathering resources. Also it's difficult to know which all shops are open. So here the core concept is that you have latest information.

1. Once shopkeeper adds his listing, it's only valid for 2 days and by then he has to relist the same.
2. User's will only see the live shops that are there.
3. Also users can call the shopkeepers for zero contact home delivery from the listings.

## How can i contribute ?

Everyone is welcome to contribute. Will have a contributors page once we have enough contributors
